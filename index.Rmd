# Keywords about Me

### Academic  

<div style="border: 2px solid #4CAF50; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">

I'm focused on tackling mathematical challenges, particularly those involving probability, statistics, and algorithm design.  

+ **Innovative Solutions to Nonlinear Partial Differential Problems**  
As a project leader in Kunshan, China, I simulated 10,000 paths using the Feynman-Kac driving equation, establishing boundary conditions. I derived functions to solve nonlinear equations based on American option pricing techniques and employed Monte Carlo simulations for uncertainty quantification.

+ **Comparison of Few-Shot Learning Models**  
In another project, I led a team to implement a relation network for few-shot learning using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on the CUB-200 dataset. We developed three relation modules to enhance forecasting performance and achieved higher prediction accuracy through extensive model pre-training.

+ **QOS-Aware Reinforcement Learning-Based Computing**  
Currently, I‚Äôm working on a capstone project supervised by Dr. Peng Sun, developing a multi-vehicle IoT system utilizing deep reinforcement learning for task offloading. This project optimizes resource allocation to improve computational efficiency and reduce latency.

+ **Global Health Project**  
As an undergraduate researcher in a global health project, I collaborated on a cost-effectiveness analysis of chronic non-transmissible diseases, enhancing existing models for public health applications.
